This is a workplace management program that enables reservation of tables or rooms for work on an hourly basis along with the calculation of drinks served. The program records customer data, which includes their name, phone number, date of birth, and reservation details. The customer's name is saved for the duration of their reservation until they finish their work and wish to settle the bill for the time and drinks consumed.

The process to run a program involves downloading the setup file and then launching it on your desktop.
